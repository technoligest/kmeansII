This is an implementation of the Kmeans|| algorithm based on the work
of Bahmani e. al.

The purpose of this repo is to imrpove on the above mentioned algorithm,
through careful algorithms engineering.

This work is being done in collaboration with Dr. Norbert Zeh, and Dr.
Vlado Keselj at Dalhousie University, Faculty of Computer Science.

#### lib (folder)
This includes all the files that are in the project. This icnludes the

#### tests (folder)
This folder includes all the files needed for unit testing the project.

#### pkgs (folder)
This folder includes all of the past packages that have been included.
