\chapter{Doing It}

\section{Getting Ready}

Get all the parts that I need.  I can throw in a whole pile of terms like
preparation,
methodology,
forethought,
and
analysis
as examples for me to use in the future.

\section{Next Step}

Do it!

Of course, you have to have pictures to show how you did it to make people
understand things better.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Did it!
